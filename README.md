# alsSocketChat

Simple chat application using an express server and Socket.io for realtime server communication.

Node is required. Install dependencies, in terminal, 'node index.js' then open a browser window to 'localhost:3000' and enter a funny username.

Open another browser window or tab. Enter an even funnier username. Type to yourself from these hilarious usernames.

If you want to take it a step further, open YET ANOTHER browser window and create AN EVEN FUNNIER USERNAME. It would be so funny if you did this and sent messages to yourself from these side-splitting usernames. 

Feel free to share screenshots via email of conversations between your unique and comical usernames. LOL

Thanks for stopping by!
